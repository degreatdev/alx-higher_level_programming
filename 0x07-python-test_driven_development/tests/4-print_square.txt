 print_square - print square with the character #
 size (int): first argument takes integer

NB: Other data types apart from integer is not supported
------------------------------------------
Import the function required for testing from the module   
    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square                                                      

Start testing with some different inputs

#Test for size is filled with correct input
    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

#Test for size is filled with large value
    >>> print_square(10)

#Test for size is set to zero
    >>> print_square(0)
    

#Test for size is negative value
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-2)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be >= 0

#Test for size is a string
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square("one")
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer

#Test for size is float and less than zero
    >>> try:
    ...     print_square(-2.85)
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    size must be an integer
