      Add-integer Test file

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a test file for add_integer module
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 add_integer - compute the sum of two integer and return the result
 a (int): first argument should contain integer or float value
 b (int): second argument should contain integer or float value
          b is initialise to 98 (b = 98)
NB: Other data types apart from int and float are not supported
------------------------------------------
Import the function required for testing from the module

    >>> add_integer = __import__('0-add_integer').add_integer

Start testing with some correct input

#Test for a is integer and b is integer
    >>> print(add_integer(2, 4))
    6

#Test for a is float and b is negative int
    >>> print(add_integer(5.4, -3))
    2

#Test for a is negative float and b is float
    >>> print(add_integer(-3.7, 5.2))
    2

#Test for a is bool and b is int
    >>> try:
    ...     print(add_integer(True, 5))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    a must be an integer

#Test for a is float and b is empty
    >>> print(add_integer(98.6, ))
    196

#Test for both are None
    >>> try:
    ...     print(add_integer(None))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    a must be an integer

#Test for a is int and b is string
    >>> try:
    ...     print(add_integer(34, "Two"))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    b must be an integer

#Test for a is float and b is array
    >>> try:
    ...     print(add_integer(55.40, ["3", 6, 8, 9]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    b must be an integer
