ugly.\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than \
complex.\nComplex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better \
than nested.\nSparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\nSpecial \
cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough practicality \
beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly \
silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\nThere \
should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\nAlthough \
that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is better \
than never.\nAlthough never is often better than *right* now.\nIf the \
implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation \
is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great \
idea -- let's do more of those!"
